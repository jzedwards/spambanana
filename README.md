_[[VSCode]]_ is a code editor, with debug and task tools. It is (imho) the best place to edit text files (like source code). Strictly, it is not an IDE (interactive development environment), but if it quacks like a duckâ€¦ [[VSCode]] extensions add functions to [[VSCode]], either to help in coding, or linking to other systems and capabilities (like _[[github]]_)

_[[git]]_ is a source code control system (_SCCS_) which tracks changes to code, and allows for cooperative development. However, even working as a single developer, it provides a powerful code control tool.

_[[GitHub]]_ is a cloud store for code content, which works closely with [[git]] ([[git]] and [[github]] are **NOT** the same). [[github]] offers the ability to collaboratively work with other devs, or just to share your work, or see how others work.
