_[[VSCode]]_ is a code editor, with debug and task tools. It is (imho) the best place to edit text files (like source code). Strictly, it is not an IDE (interactive development environment), but if it quacks like a duckâ€¦ [[VSCode]] extensions add functions to [[VSCode]], either to help in coding, or linking to other systems and capabilities (like _[[GitHub]]_)
